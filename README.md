Your Neighborhood
======================

An app that allows users to stay aware of their government officials
--------------------------------------------------------------------

This project was originally built with jQuery and Bootstrap. Once I learned how to use Angular I worked it in so I could remove some code from the HTML.

I made use of the CiceroData API to retrieve information about every current elected official in the US. Then I matched that data with the Google Maps
API to search the location entered by the user.

Working on this project allowed me to get in depth with delivering data to users using AJAX.

*To Do*
- *update with Sunlight Foundation once Cicero key expires*
- *embed first url in politician's name*
- *add map markers*
- *add phone numbers*
- *use NYT API to include voting records*
- *make hybrid app*
- *come up with a better title*
